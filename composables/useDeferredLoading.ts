/**
 * What a panel shows while it is waiting, without the strobe.
 *
 * Two different waits were being drawn the same way. A panel opening for the
 * first time has nothing on screen, so it needs a placeholder -- but it was
 * getting one that could come and go inside 80ms, which reads as a flash
 * rather than as loading. A panel refetching after a filter change already has
 * the previous answer up, and throwing that away for a wall of boxes is
 * strictly worse than leaving it there.
 *
 * So: the first load always gets the placeholder, and once shown it stays long
 * enough to be a state rather than a blink. Every load after that keeps the
 * content and only dims it, and only if the wait is long enough to notice.
