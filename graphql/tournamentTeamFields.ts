/**
 * `tournament_teams.checked_in_at` is the ONE check-in signal anything
 * downstream reads — nothing outside the feature has to know which
 * `check_in_setting` mode produced it. `checked_in` is its computed companion,
 * and the roster's own stamp only ever matters in `Players` mode.
 *
 * Both chunks are spread as untyped objects on purpose: these columns land with
 * the API migration, and until `yarn codegen` runs against a migrated stack the
 * generated Zeus selection type maps every unrecognised key to `never` — which
 * would be a compile error not just here but at every call site that reuses
 * this selector. Fold the keys into the literals and delete the casts once
 * codegen has run.
